For may final project, the pdf file "Final Document" is the final version file that should be read. I am not sure if it will
works on any other computers, thus the file "Final paper" is the Word version of the file. either one is okay. the code for
html and R are also uploaded. for the Javascripts code, I insert the code inside the html files. All the Html file coud be 
run on sage. For the R code. I am not sure if it will work on any other computers. It will need the "boot and bootstrap" 
package for R.

=============

Final project
In the final project, I have two ideas but not decided which one i will working on finally. I decided to work on both 
ideas and decided later.
First project:
I want to write a method about a game called Suduku. Suduku is a very popular math number game. Sudoku is a logic-based,
combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and 
each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides 
a partially completed grid, which typically has a unique solution.

In my project, I want to create a timer and two counters. The timer is to time the total time you use for the game. and the 
first counter is for the right moves, and second counter is for total moves.

Second project:
I want to create a class, which contains several methods that work for the statistics. Mostly works for hypothesis tests and 
distribution. For example, given a set of datas, use the datas to calculate the tests, confidence interval, and prodict
the next data and drawing a distribution for the number. Also it will provide standard diviation, standard error, mean, 
and variance.

I will add more thing in project 2, this is a direction for my project.

Final project process HOMEWORK 6 is here !!!!!!!

Ok, so far I just finished collecting data and started using data as an example for my project. I decided to make
a project that using an input data and giving out the feedback such as the distributions, information, and some ideas
about the data. For example, right now I have a data about the traffic accidents on I5 in Washington. The data 
contains the information of number of injury, number of kills, number of cars involved and numbers of accidents.
I want to use this data to draw a distribution and summarize the ideas about which part of the I5 is the easiest 
place to happen accidents, which part of road is safer, and some general factor about the mean, variance and confidence
interval about data. And I also use the results of my data to compare the whole I5 highway (from California to
Washington). By looking at results and distribution, it is easy to find the reason that why some specific area that 
has more traffics than others. 
So far I am still working on this data, and I also want to make another data about how to use my project to find the
best way to start a gas station business.

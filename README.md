=============

Final project
In the final project, I have two ideas but not decided which one i will working on finally. I decided to work on both 
ideas and decided later.
First project:
I want to write a method about a game called Suduku. Suduku is a very popular math number game. Sudoku is a logic-based,
combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and 
each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides 
a partially completed grid, which typically has a unique solution.

In my project, I want to create a timer and two counters. The timer is to time the total time you use for the game. and the 
first counter is for the right moves, and second counter is for total moves.

Second project:
I want to create a class, which contains several methods that work for the statistics. Mostly works for hypothesis tests and 
distribution. For example, given a set of datas, use the datas to calculate the tests, confidence interval, and prodict
the next data and drawing a distribution for the number. Also it will provide standard diviation, standard error, mean, 
and variance.


I will add more thing in project 2, this is a direction for my project.
